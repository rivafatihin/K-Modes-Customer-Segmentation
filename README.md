# Customer Segmentation with K-modes
Electric Vehicle Customer Segmentation

# 1. Business Framing & Project overview

## Background
Indonesiaâ€™s transportation sector, including automotive industry, has been the highest final energy consumer, contribute 27% of total energy use & become primary source of CO2 emissions in the road transportation sector.
As carbon emissions and reliance on fossil energy have become important concerns in Indonesia, developing electric vehicles is considered a possible solution due to their energy efficiency.
The project's key contribution is its approach to segmenting the battery electric vehicle market using different groups of consumer profiles.

## Dataset source information
Dataset source from my own personal survey for academic purpose.

## Objective
This project is try to answer below business question:
1.   What is the segmentation and characteristic of Indonesian battery electric vehicles?
2.   What is the most suitable battery electric vehicle basic product concept for each segmented market?


# 2. Data understanding

## Data Info
1. Data contains 12 columns with 422 rows.
2. Several columns have missing values, will handle later.
3. All dtypes is categorical.


# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

## Spending per year with Vehicle Purchase relation

Respondent with Spending < 200 M IDR up to 300 M IDR consider to buy electric vehicle with price 300-400 M IDR. While Respondent with Spending 300 - above 350 M IDR consider Electric Vehicle with price above 500 M IDR.

## Age Range with Vehicle Model relation

Millenials favorable MPV, City car, Gen-z love City car & Babyboomers love MPV & City Car.


# 4. Clustering model (K-modes)

1. K-Modes Intialization
2. Choose k (number of cluster) by elbow method
3. Combining predicted cluster with Original dataframe


# 5. Cluster/Segment Identification

## First Cluster - "Price Sensitive"
*   Cluster #1 is the biggest segment with 280 members or 
67% of total participants. This segment is a price-sensitive 
group that prioritizes purchasing price when choosing 
battery-electric vehicles and considers City Car vehicle model with 3 hrs charging time & 350 Km Driving Range.
*   This Cluster dominated by Female, Millenials (25-40 years old). Mostly live in West Java. Most of them are married with Bachelor as the last education & Private employee as their profession. They spend less than 200 million rupiahs/year.

## Second Cluster - "Value Seeker"
*   Cluster #2 is second biggest segment with 83 members or 20% of total participants. This segment is a Value Seeker group that prioritizes purchasing price when choosing electric vehicles but still looking for affordable value in class and considers MPV vehicle model with 3 hrs charging time & 350 Km Driving Range.
*   This Cluster dominated by Male, gen-Z (18-24 years old). Mostly live in Jakarta surround area. Most of them are single with Bachelor as the last education & Student as their profession. They spend less than 200 million rupiahs/year.

## Third Cluster - "Premium"
*   Cluster #3 is the last segment with 54 members or 13% of total participants. This segment is a Premium group that looking for best value in class when choosing electric vehicles,  they considers MPV vehicle model with 5 hrs charging time & 350 Km Driving Range.
*   This Cluster dominated by Male, Milenialls (25-40 years old). Mostly live in Jakarta surround area. Most of them are Married with Bachelor as the last education & Private employee as their profession. They spend between 200-250 million rupiahs/year.

# Customer Segmentation with K-modes
Electric Vehicle Customer Segmentation

# 1. Business Framing & Project overview

## Background
Indonesiaâ€™s transportation sector, including automotive industry, has been the highest final energy consumer, contribute 27% of total energy use & become primary source of CO2 emissions in the road transportation sector.
As carbon emissions and reliance on fossil energy have become important concerns in Indonesia, developing electric vehicles is considered a possible solution due to their energy efficiency.
The project's key contribution is its approach to segmenting the battery electric vehicle market using different groups of consumer profiles.

## Dataset source information
Dataset source from my own personal survey for academic purpose.

## Objective
This project is try to answer below business question:
1.   What is the segmentation and characteristic of Indonesian battery electric vehicles?
2.   What is the most suitable battery electric vehicle basic product concept for each segmented market?

Millenials favorable MPV, City car, Gen-z love City car & Babyboomers love MPV & City Car.


# 4. Clustering model (K-modes)

1. K-Modes Intialization
2. Choose k (number of cluster) by elbow method
3. Combining predicted cluster with Original dataframe
